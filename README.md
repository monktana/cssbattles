# CSS Battle

Let's design with code! 

These are my solutions for some problems on cssbattle.dev.
My goal for these challenges is not to write as little code as possible, but to learn new stuff and write easy to read code.

## Scoring

I wanted to come up with solutions that are easy to understand and read.
